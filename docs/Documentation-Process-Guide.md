# Multi-Tier Documentation Process Guide

## Overview

This guide defines our three-tier documentation process for technical features, from initial concept to implementation record.

## Tier 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 6. Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1**: [Core infrastructure] - [What will be built?]
- **Phase 2**: [Feature implementation] - [What will be built?]
- **Phase 3**: [Integration & testing] - [What will be built?]

## 7. Questions & Uncertainties

- **Technical Questions**: [What technical decisions need to be made?]
- **Integration Questions**: [What integration challenges need to be solved?]
- **Research Needed**: [What needs to be researched or prototyped?]
```

## Tier 3: Implementation Record (IR)

### Purpose

Document the actual implementation, integration patterns, and lessons learned.

### Template

```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Implementation Record

## Document Information

- **Status**: [Implemented/Deprecated]
- **Implementation Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Version**: [1.0]
- **Contributors**: [List of developers]

## 1. Implementation Summary

- **Final Architecture**: [What was actually built?]
- **Key Decisions**: [What architectural decisions were made?]
- **Integration Patterns**: [How does it integrate with the system?]

## 2. Code Structure

- **Core Classes**: [What classes were created?]
- **File Organization**: [Where are the files located?]
- **Namespace Structure**: [How is the code organized?]

## 3. Integration Points

- **WordPress Integration**: [How does it hook into WordPress?]
- **System Integration**: [How does it work with existing features?]
- **API Usage**: [How do other parts of the system use it?]

## 4. Configuration & Usage

- **Setup Requirements**: [What configuration is needed?]
- **Usage Examples**: [How do developers use this feature?]
- **Best Practices**: [What patterns work well?]

## 5. Testing & Quality

- **Test Coverage**: [What tests were written?]
- **Performance Results**: [How does it perform?]
- **Known Issues**: [What issues were discovered?]

## 6. Lessons Learned

- **What Worked Well**: [What went smoothly?]
- **Challenges**: [What was difficult?]
- **Future Improvements**: [What could be better?]

## 7. Maintenance Notes

- **Monitoring**: [What should be monitored?]
- **Common Issues**: [What problems might occur?]
- **Troubleshooting**: [How to debug common issues?]
```

## Process Flow

### 1. Feature Proposal

- Create **Tier 1 (PRD)** for new features
- Review and approve

### 2. Technical Planning

- Create **Tier 2 (TFS)** based on approved PRD
- Define implementation approach

### 3. Implementation

- Follow **Tier 2 (TFS)** during development
- Update as needed during implementation

### 4. Documentation

- Create **Tier 3 (IR)** after implementation
- Capture actual implementation and integration patterns

## File Naming Convention

```js
docs/
├── PRDs/
│   └── [feature-name]-prd.md
├── TFSs/
│   └── [feature-name]-tfs.md
└── IRs/
    └── [feature-name]-ir.md
```

## Benefits of This Process

### For Teams

- **Clear Communication**: Each tier serves different audiences
- **Progressive Detail**: Information becomes more specific as you move through tiers
- **Decision Tracking**: Changes and decisions are documented at each level
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can understand both what and how

### For Maintenance

- **Implementation Records**: Future developers understand how features actually work
- **Integration Patterns**: Clear documentation of how features interact
- **Troubleshooting**: Known issues and solutions are documented
- **Evolution**: Easy to see how features have evolved over time

### For Quality

- **Review Process**: Multiple review points ensure quality
- **Testing Strategy**: Clear testing requirements at each level
- **Performance Tracking**: Performance requirements and results are documented
- **Security**: Security considerations are addressed at each level

## When to Use Each Tier

### Always Create Tier 1 (PRD) When

- Proposing a new feature
- Major feature enhancement
- Architecture changes
- Integration with external systems

### Create Tier 2 (TFS) When

- Feature requires technical design
- Multiple implementation options exist
- Integration with existing systems is complex
- Performance or security requirements are significant

### Always Create Tier 3 (IR) When

- Feature implementation is complete
- Integration patterns are established
- Lessons learned should be captured
- Future maintenance will be needed

## Example: Your Block Asset Management Feature

### Tier 1 (PRD): "Block Asset Management"

- Problem: WordPress blocks need conditional asset loading
- Goal: Load block assets only when blocks are present
- Success: Performance improvement, reduced HTTP requests

### Tier 2 (TFS): "Block Asset Management Architecture"

- Architecture: Extend existing asset system with block awareness
- API: BlockRegistrar class with WordPress integration
- Implementation: BlockAssetTrait, WordPress hook integration

### Tier 3 (IR): "Block Asset Management Implementation"

- Actual classes: BlockRegistrar, BlockAssetTrait
- Integration: WordPress filter-based enhancement
- Lessons: WordPress timing constraints, conditional loading patterns

This process ensures that your documentation evolves with your understanding of the feature, from initial concept through implementation to maintenance.
