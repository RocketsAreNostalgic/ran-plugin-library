```

## Process Flow

### 1. Feature Proposal

- Create **Tier 1 (PRD)** for new features
- Review and approve business requirements

### 2. Technical Planning

- Create **Tier 2 (FPD)** based on approved PRD
- Explore implementation approaches and alternatives
- Define overall technical strategy

### 3. Technical Specification

- Create **Tier 3 (TFS)** based on FPD decisions
- Define detailed implementation specifications
- Include specific APIs, performance requirements, and testing strategy

### 4. Implementation

- Follow **Tier 3 (TFS)** during development
- Update TFS as needed during implementation

## File Naming Convention

```js
docs/
├── PRDs/
│   └── [feature-name]-prd.md
├── FPDs/
│   └── [feature-name]-fpd.md
└── TFSs/
    └── TFS-###-[feature-name].md
```

**Note**: TFS documents use a numbered format (TFS-001, TFS-002, etc.) to indicate implementation order and dependencies.

## Benefits of This Process

### For Teams

- **Clear Communication**: Each tier serves different audiences
- **Progressive Detail**: Information becomes more specific as you move through tiers
- **Decision Tracking**: Changes and decisions are documented at each level
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can understand both what and how

### For Maintenance

- **Implementation Records**: Future developers understand how features actually work
- **Integration Patterns**: Clear documentation of how features interact
- **Troubleshooting**: Known issues and solutions are documented
- **Evolution**: Easy to see how features have evolved over time

### For Quality

- **Review Process**: Multiple review points ensure quality
- **Testing Strategy**: Clear testing requirements at each level
- **Performance Tracking**: Performance requirements and results are documented
- **Security**: Security considerations are addressed at each level

## When to Use Each Tier

### Always Create Tier 1 (PRD) When

- Proposing a new feature
- Major feature enhancement
- Architecture changes
- Integration with external systems

### Create Tier 2 (FPD) When

- Feature requires technical planning
- Multiple implementation approaches need evaluation
- Integration strategy needs to be defined
- Technical feasibility needs to be explored

### Always Create Tier 3 (TFS) When

- Feature requires detailed technical specification
- Specific APIs need to be defined
- Performance or security requirements are significant
- Implementation phases need to be planned
- Testing strategy needs to be documented

## Example: Block Asset Management Feature

### Tier 1 (PRD): "Block Asset Management"

- **Problem**: WordPress blocks need conditional asset loading
- **Goal**: Load block assets only when blocks are present
- **Success**: Performance improvement, reduced HTTP requests

### Tier 2 (FPD): "Block Asset Management Planning"

- **Technical Vision**: Extend existing asset system with block awareness
- **Approaches**: Evaluate hook-based vs. render-time detection
- **Integration Strategy**: BlockRegistrar class with WordPress integration
- **Recommended**: Hook-based approach for better performance

### Tier 3 (TFS): "Block Asset Management Specification"

- **API Design**: Specific BlockRegistrar methods and BlockAssetTrait interface
- **Implementation**: Detailed WordPress hook integration patterns
- **Performance**: Specific performance targets and testing strategy
- **Testing**: Unit test requirements for block detection logic

This process ensures that your documentation evolves with your understanding of the feature, from initial business concept through technical planning to detailed implementation specification.
