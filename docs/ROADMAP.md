# Plugin Library Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for completing and enhancing the WordPress Plugin Library. The library provides a comprehensive foundation for WordPress plugin development with modular components for asset management, features organization, configuration, and more.

## Current Status

The library is **approximately 75% complete** with core infrastructure in place. The primary focus is on completing existing components, improving documentation, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

## 🎯 High Priority - EnqueueAccessory System

### MediaTrait Completion

**Status**: 🟡 Partially Complete
**Priority**: High

**Current State:**

- ✅ Basic `MediaEnqueueTrait` structure exists
- ✅ Core `add()` and `stage_media()` methods implemented
- ❌ Missing comprehensive testing
- ❌ Missing integration with `MediaHandler` class
- ❌ Missing documentation and usage examples

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Complete `MediaHandler` class implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for `MediaEnqueueTrait`
- [ ] Create integration tests with WordPress media API
- [ ] Document media asset management patterns
- [ ] Add usage examples for media uploader integration
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing asset management architecture

### Block Asset Management

**Status**: 🟢 Nearly Complete
**Priority**: High

**Current State:**

- ✅ `BlockRegistrar` class implemented
- ✅ `BlockAssetTrait` functionality complete
- ✅ WordPress integration patterns established
- ✅ ADR-002 timing documentation complete
- ❌ Unit tests need updates for recent refactoring
- ❌ Integration tests needed

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Update `BlockRegistrarTest.php` for composition-based architecture
- [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking for block asset loading
- [ ] Complete usage documentation with real-world examples
- [ ] Validate WordPress 6.4+ compatibility

## 🔍 Low Priority - Evaluation & Cleanup

### HooksAccessory Evaluation

**Status**: 🟡 Needs Evaluation
**Priority**: Low

**Current State:**

- ✅ `ActionHooksManager` and `FilterHooksManager` implemented
- ❓ Unclear if this provides value over direct WordPress hook usage
- ❓ Limited adoption in current codebase
- ❓ May be redundant with modern WordPress patterns

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: Review current usage across library and plugins
- [ ] **Value Assessment**: Compare benefits vs. WordPress native patterns
- [ ] **Maintenance Cost**: Evaluate ongoing maintenance requirements
- [ ] **Decision**: Keep, enhance, or remove

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Keep**: If it provides clear organizational benefits
- **Enhance**: Add features like hook priority management, conditional registration
- **Remove**: If it's redundant or adds unnecessary complexity

### Users Component Evaluation

**Status**: 🟡 Needs Evaluation
**Priority**: Low

**Current State:**

- ✅ `InsertUserDataAbstract` class exists
- ❓ Very specific use case (user insertion)
- ❓ May not belong in a general-purpose library
- ❓ Limited functionality compared to WordPress native functions

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- [ ] **Scope Assessment**: Does this fit library's purpose?
- [ ] **Usage Analysis**: How often is this needed?
- [ ] **Alternative Solutions**: Can this be handled by plugins directly?
- [ ] **Decision**: Keep, enhance, or remove

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Keep**: If user management is a common plugin need
- **Enhance**: Add more user management utilities
- **Remove**: If it's too specific for a general library

### Singleton Pattern Enhancement

**Status**: 🟡 Basic Implementation
**Priority**: Low

**Current State:**

- ✅ `SingletonAbstract` and `Singleton` classes implemented
- ✅ Basic singleton pattern working
- ❌ Comprehensive testing missing
- ❌ Documentation incomplete
- ❌ Modern PHP patterns not fully utilized

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test suite
  - [ ] Singleton instance management
  - [ ] Inheritance scenarios
  - [ ] Thread safety considerations
- [ ] **Documentation**: Usage patterns and best practices
  - [ ] When to use vs. dependency injection
  - [ ] Integration with other library components
- [ ] **Enhancement**: Modern PHP features
  - [ ] PHP 8+ attribute support
  - [ ] Better type safety
