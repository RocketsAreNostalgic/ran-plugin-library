# Reconcile Hooks System Development Branches - Product Requirements Document

## Document Information

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None

## 1. Problem Statement

**Current State**: Development work has occurred on two separate branches (`main` and `feat/hooks`) and in a stash, leading to diverged codebases for the Hooks and Utilities features.

- `main` contains refactoring of `HooksAccessory`.
- `feat/hooks` contains significant changes to `WPWrappersTrait.php`, including moving it to a `utils` directory.
- Work done accidentally on `main` (including another move of `WPWrappersTrait.php` and test fixes) is now in a stash.

This divergence is blocking further development.

**User Impact**: This is a developer-facing issue. It prevents the clean integration of features and creates a high risk of losing work or introducing bugs if not reconciled carefully. Continued development is blocked until the branches are merged.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal**: To create a single, stable branch that incorporates all desired changes from both `main` (and the related stash) and the `feat/hooks` branch, resolving all conflicts.
- **Success Metrics**: A new branch exists where all unit tests pass. The new branch contains the updated `HooksAccessory` from `main` and the enhanced `WPWrappersTrait.php` from `feat/hooks`, and any other work from the stash.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - A new branch, e.g., `feat/hooks-reconciliation`, is created from `main`.
  - Changes from `feat/hooks` are merged into the new branch.
  - Changes from the stash are applied to the new branch.
  - All merge conflicts are resolved correctly.
  - All unit tests pass successfully via `composer test`.
  - The final code structure is logical and agreed upon (e.g., `WPWrappersTrait.php` is in its final intended location).
  - All tests pass `composer test`

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Core Functionality**:
  - Integrate the refactored `HooksAccessory` from the `main` branch.
  - Integrate the moved and updated `WPWrappersTrait.php` from the `feat/hooks` branch.
  - Apply any other relevant changes from the stash.
- **Integration Points**: The reconciled code must integrate seamlessly with the existing plugin architecture.
- **Performance Requirements**: No performance degradation should result from the merge.

## 4. Dependencies

- **Internal Dependencies**: The `HooksAccessory` and `WPWrappersTrait.php` are interdependent. The reconciliation must ensure they function correctly together.
- **External Dependencies**: None.
- **WordPress Dependencies**: No new dependencies beyond what already exists.

## 5. Risks & Assumptions

- **Technical Risks**:
  - Merge conflicts could be complex, increasing the risk of incorrect resolution.
  - Potential for accidental loss of changes from either branch or the stash during the merge process.
  - Subtle bugs may be introduced if conflicts are not resolved with a full understanding of the code's intent.
  - Existing tests may not cover all integration points, potentially leaving undetected issues.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The stashed changes represent a complete and isolated set of the work done accidentally on `main`.
  - The project's tests provide sufficient coverage to validate the correctness of the final merged code.
