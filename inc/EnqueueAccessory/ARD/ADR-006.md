# ADR-007: Hook Registration Tracking in Asset Enqueue System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Asset Enqueue System needs to register WordPress hooks for deferred assets and external inline assets. These hooks need to be registered only once per hook name (for external inline assets) or once per hook name and priority combination (for deferred assets) to prevent duplicate registrations and ensure predictable behavior.

The system uses two primary hook registration patterns:

1. **For deferred assets**: Closures/anonymous functions are used as callbacks
2. **For external inline assets**: Array callbacks (`array($this, 'method_name')`) are used

We need a reliable mechanism to track which hooks have already been registered to prevent duplicate registrations.

## Decision

We have decided to use dedicated tracking arrays to manage hook registrations:

1. `$registered_hooks`: Tracks hook+priority combinations for deferred assets
   ```php
   protected array $registered_hooks = array();
   ```

2. `$registered_external_hooks`: Tracks hooks for external inline assets
   ```php
   protected array $registered_external_hooks = array();
   ```

These arrays act as simple boolean flags to prevent duplicate action registrations. The implementation looks like:

```php
// For deferred assets
if (!isset($this->registered_hooks[$hook_name . '_' . $priority])) {
    $callback = function() use ($hook_name, $priority, $context) {
        if (method_exists($this, $context)) {
            $this->{$context}($hook_name, $priority);
        }
    };
    
    $this->_do_add_action($hook_name, $callback, $priority, 0);
    $this->registered_hooks[$hook_name . '_' . $priority] = true;
}

// For external inline assets
if (!isset($this->registered_external_hooks[$hook])) {
    $enqueue_method = 'enqueue_external_inline_' . $asset_type->value . 's';
    add_action($hook, array($this, $enqueue_method), 11);
    $this->registered_external_hooks[$hook] = true;
}
```

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Using WordPress's `has_action()` Function

```php
$callback = function() use ($hook_name, $priority, $context) { /* ... */ };
if (!has_action($hook_name, $callback)) {
    add_action($hook_name, $callback, $priority);
}
```

**Rejected because**:

- **Closure Identity Issues**: PHP treats each closure as a unique object, even if they have identical code. `has_action()` compares function objects by identity, not by code equivalence.
  
  ```php
  $func1 = function() { echo "Hello"; };
  $func2 = function() { echo "Hello"; };
  // $func1 !== $func2, even though they're functionally identical
  ```

- **Performance Concerns**: `has_action()` performs a deep search through WordPress's hook registry, which is less efficient than a direct array lookup, especially for hooks with many callbacks.

- **Reliability Issues**: For array callbacks like `array($this, 'method_name')`, `has_action()` requires the exact same object instance. If checking from a different context or if the object has been recreated, `has_action()` would fail.

- **Testing Complexity**: In test environments, WordPress hook functions are often mocked or shimmed, making `has_action()` checks unreliable.

### 2. Hook-Specific Flags in Asset Definitions

```php
// For external inline assets:
if (!isset($this->external_inline_assets[$hook]['_hook_registered'])) {
    add_action($hook, array($this, $enqueue_method), 11);
    $this->external_inline_assets[$hook]['_hook_registered'] = true;
}
```

**Rejected because**:

- **Mixing Concerns**: This approach mixes asset data with hook registration tracking, violating separation of concerns.
  
- **Data Structure Pollution**: Adds non-asset metadata to asset data structures, which could lead to confusion and potential bugs.
  
- **Consistency Issues**: Asset data might be cleared or modified independently of hook registration status, leading to inconsistent state.

### 3. Single Registration Tracking Property

```php
protected array $registered_actions = array();

// Usage
$action_key = $hook . '_' . $priority . '_' . $context;
if (!isset($this->registered_actions[$action_key])) {
    add_action($hook, $callback, $priority);
    $this->registered_actions[$action_key] = true;
}
```

**Rejected because**:

- **Overcomplicates Key Generation**: Requires complex key generation logic to handle different hook types.
  
- **Reduced Clarity**: Makes it harder to distinguish between different types of hook registrations.
  
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Any changes to how hooks are registered would require updating the key generation logic.

### 4. Stateless Approach with Function Memoization

```php
private function register_hook_once(string $hook, callable $callback, int $priority = 10): void {
    static $registered = array();
    
    $key = $hook . '_' . $priority . '_' . spl_object_hash($callback);
    if (!isset($registered[$key])) {
        add_action($hook, $callback, $priority);
        $registered[$key] = true;
    }
}
```

**Rejected because**:

- **Testing Difficulties**: Static variables persist across test cases, making isolation difficult.
  
- **Reduced Visibility**: Makes it harder to inspect the current registration state.
  
- **Scope Limitations**: Static variables are limited to function scope, making it harder to share state across related methods.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Simple and Efficient**: Direct array lookups are fast and straightforward.
  
- **Clear Separation**: Maintains clear separation between asset data and hook registration tracking.
  
- **Reliable**: Works consistently regardless of callback type (closures, array callbacks, etc.).
  
- **Testable**: Easy to mock or inspect in test environments.

### Negative

- **Additional Class Properties**: Requires maintaining separate tracking arrays.
  
- **Manual Synchronization**: If hook registration logic changes, tracking arrays must be updated accordingly.

## Implementation Notes

The tracking arrays are only used during the registration phase and are not referenced for any logic afterward. They serve as simple boolean flags to prevent duplicate action registrations.

Asset queues are cleaned up after processing, but hook registration tracking remains intact throughout the request lifecycle. This is intentional, as WordPress hooks should only be registered once per request, regardless of whether the assets they process have been cleaned up.
