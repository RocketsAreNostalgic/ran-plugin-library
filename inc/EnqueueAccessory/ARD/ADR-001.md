# ADR-001: Asset Enqueuing and Hook Registration

**Date:** 2025-06-25
**Status:** Accepted
**Updated:** 2025-07-18

## Context

The WordPress plugin asset enqueueing lifecycle requires that all actions (like `add_action('wp_head', ...)` or `add_action('custom_hook', ...)` ) be registered during the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook. However, the full processing of assets—which determines if they have head/footer callbacks or are deferred to a custom hook—happens within the same `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook.

This creates a critical timing issue: the system doesn't know it needs to register a `wp_head` action until _after_ the window to register that action has already passed. The `EnqueuePublic::stage_assets()/EnqueueAdmin::stage_assets()` methods, which are responsible for registering these hooks, runs before the asset processing is complete.

## Decision

### Original Approach (Legacy)

Originally, we implemented a "preemptive check" or "look-ahead" mechanism in the methods responsible for reporting asset requirements. Specifically, `get_head_callbacks()`, `get_footer_callbacks()`, and `get_deferred_hooks()` inspected the raw, unprocessed `$assets` array in addition to the processed asset arrays.

These methods looked for asset definitions that contained properties (`'data'`, `'hook'`) indicating that they _would require_ a future action (`wp_head`, `wp_footer`, or a custom hook).

This allowed the `EnqueuePublic::stage_assets()` method to get a complete and accurate picture of all necessary hooks upfront and register them at the correct time within the WordPress lifecycle.

### Current Approach

The system now uses a more direct approach by registering hooks dynamically during the asset staging process. Instead of using a "look-ahead" mechanism, the `stage_assets()` method now registers WordPress actions with closures for each deferred asset at the time of staging.

This approach has several advantages:

1. **Simplified Logic**: No need to scan assets twice (once for look-ahead, once for processing)
2. **Direct Hook Registration**: Hooks are registered exactly when they're needed during the staging process
3. **Reduced Coupling**: Asset processing is no longer tied to the internal structure of the raw asset array

The legacy helper methods (`get_head_callbacks()`, `get_footer_callbacks()`, and `get_deferred_hooks()`) have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They are currently maintained only for backward compatibility with existing tests and implementations.

## Alternatives Considered

### Process Assets During `stage_assets()`

We considered eliminating the look-ahead mechanism by simply processing all assets inside the `EnqueuePublic::stage_assets()` method. This would populate the `head_callbacks`, `footer_callbacks`, and `deferred_assets` arrays directly, making the look-ahead logic redundant.

**Why this was rejected:** The `stage_assets()` method is designed to run early in the WordPress lifecycle (e.g., on `init`) to schedule actions. The official and only correct time to _call_ `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()` is during the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook, which fires much later. Processing assets inside `stage_assets()` would force us to enqueue them too early, which would break all conditional loading (e.g., `is_page()`, `is_singular()`). This would be a critical loss of functionality and a major performance anti-pattern.

### Dynamic Hook Registration (Current Implementation)

Instead of using a look-ahead mechanism, we now register WordPress hooks dynamically during the asset staging process. Each deferred asset gets its hook registered with a closure that will be executed when the hook fires.

**Why this was adopted:** This approach eliminates the need for the look-ahead mechanism entirely. It simplifies the codebase by removing duplicate logic and reduces coupling between components. The `stage_assets()` method now only needs to ensure that assets are staged at the appropriate time (via the `wp_enqueue_scripts` hook), and the staging process itself handles all hook registrations.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Functional Correctness:** The current approach ensures the enqueueing system is robust and reliable within the strict constraints of the WordPress action lifecycle.
- **Preserves Conditional Loading:** It allows the library to continue using `wp_enqueue_scripts` as its main hook, preserving the ability to use powerful conditional tags (e.g., `is_page()`) to stage_assets assets efficiently.
- **Encapsulated Complexity:** The timing complexity is handled internally. The end-user of the library has a simple, predictable API (`add_scripts()`, `add_styles()`) that works as expected.
- **Reduced Duplication:** The dynamic hook registration approach eliminates the duplication of logic that existed in the look-ahead mechanism.
- **Improved Maintainability:** With hooks registered directly during staging, the code is more straightforward and easier to maintain.

### Cons

- **Backward Compatibility:** Legacy helper methods (`get_head_callbacks()`, `get_footer_callbacks()`, and `get_deferred_hooks()`) must be maintained for backward compatibility until they can be safely removed.
- **Developer Responsibility:** With immediate assets, developers must manually invoke them at the appropriate time, which requires clear documentation and understanding of the WordPress hook system.

## Legacy Helper Methods

The following methods have been marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

### `get_head_callbacks()`

Originally used to identify assets that required callbacks in the document head. This method scanned both processed and unprocessed assets to determine if `wp_head` hooks needed to be registered.

### `get_footer_callbacks()`

Similar to `get_head_callbacks()`, but for footer callbacks. It identified assets that needed to be processed during the `wp_footer` hook.

### `get_deferred_hooks()`

Identified custom hooks that needed to be registered for deferred assets. This method was crucial for the look-ahead mechanism but is now redundant as hooks are registered directly during the staging process.

## Developer Guidelines

- **Deferred Assets:** These are automatically handled via hook registration during the staging process. No additional developer action is required.
- **Immediate Assets:** These require manual invocation by the developer at the appropriate time.
- **Asset Placement:** The placement of assets (header vs. footer) is determined by the asset definition itself (e.g., using the `'in_footer'` flag for scripts).
- **Timing:** The responsibility for ensuring assets are stage_assetsed at the correct time lies with the developer.
